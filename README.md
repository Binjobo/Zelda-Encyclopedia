## Next Steps

There are many areas I could have improved on for this project. Some of them may include:

1. Adding a method to prevent duplicated items being added to Favourites page.
2. Adding a link to the sub-headings in the result page of the searched item, so that clicking on it directs me to a new info page.
3. Freezing view for page title and navbar so that when I scroll for the item info below, I can always click back on the navbar to navigate to another category.
4. Adding more custom info page sub-headings and corresponding info (e.g adding a cooking effect, or hearts recovered, for items that are consumable)
